# Game Brief: Software Studio Story

**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Author:** Coleh
**Status:** Draft for GDD Development

---

## Executive Summary

*Software Studio Story* is a cozy studio management sim where you evolve a solo dev into a massive cross-functional team, grinding out contracts to build the ultimate tech company.

**Target Audience:** Casual-core mobile gamers who enjoy deep, systemic tycoon loops (Kairosoft fans) but want modern, interactive mechanics.
**Core Pillars:** The Orchestrator's Journey, Systemic Consequence, Tactile Abstraction.
**Key Differentiators:** Highly interactive Agile mechanics (the Kanban board), a strategic Culture Pendulum (Startup vs Corporate), and fair, systemic failure simulation.
**Platform:** iOS and Android (via React Native/Expo).
**Success Vision:** To build a deeply addictive tycoon game that gamifies the realities of modern software development, making players laugh at tech-industry cliches while empowering them to master the chaos of shipping great products.

## Game Vision

### Core Concept

A cozy studio management sim where you evolve a solo dev into a massive cross-functional team, grinding out contracts to build the ultimate tech company.

### Elevator Pitch

*Software Studio Story* is a cozy but deep tycoon game where you are the orchestrator of an expanding development studio. You don't just assign tasks—you build a culture, unlocking entirely new gameplay mechanics by choosing between a Ping-Pong-filled Disruptor startup or a highly optimized Enterprise firm. Manage the systemic chaos of dependencies, sick days, and demanding clients to build the ultimate tech company one sprint at a time.

*(Note for App Store A/B Testing: We have alternate pitches focusing on the "Kairosoft-style" progression and the "Stealth Learning" mechanics saved for future marketing.)*

### Vision Statement

To build a deeply addictive tycoon game that gamifies the realities of modern software development, making players laugh at tech-industry cliches while empowering them to master the chaos of shipping great products.

## Target Market

### Primary Audience

**The Tycoon / Management Sim Enthusiast**
The core demographic is casual-core mobile gamers who enjoy deep, systemic progression loops disguised under charming, accessible pixel art. They are optimization junkies who love watching numbers go up and building empires from scratch.

**Demographics:**
- Age: 18-35
- Tech-literate, often working in or adjacent to the tech/knowledge industry, but playing primarily for entertainment, not education.

**Gaming Preferences:**
- Deeply familiar with the Kairosoft catalog (*Game Dev Story*, *Mega Mall Story*).
- Enjoy premium or "fair" free-to-play mobile experiences that respect their time and don't rely on aggressive gacha mechanics.
- Favor games with strong offline/single-player progression that can be played in short bursts or long marathon sessions.

**Motivations:**
- The dopamine hit of constant, tangible progression (unlocking classes, upgrading the office).
- The strategic challenge of balancing resources (cash, morale, velocity).
- The satisfaction of taking a chaotic, messy system and optimizing it into a well-oiled machine.

### Secondary Audience

**The Tech Industry Insider (Aspiring PMs & Developers)**
Junior developers, product managers, and tech workers who will appreciate the "inside baseball" humor. They are drawn to the game because it affectionately parodies their daily lives (scope creep, tech debt, stakeholder tantrums) while giving them a power fantasy of actually controlling the chaos. 

### Market Context

**Market Opportunity:**
While *Game Dev Story* defined the studio-management genre, it focuses on the romanticized era of 90s console game development. *Software Studio Story* modernizes this formula by tackling the chaotic, buzzword-heavy reality of modern Agile software development. It taps into the massive cultural zeitgeist of the tech industry—from startup hustles to corporate tech giants—offering a fresh, relatable coat of paint on a proven mechanical loop.

**Similar Successful Games:**
- *Game Dev Story* (The mechanical benchmark for progression and UI)
- *Game Dev Tycoon* (Proof of appetite for deeper, PC-style studio management)
- *Startup Company* (Proof of concept for managing modern web/software products)

## Game Fundamentals

### Core Gameplay Pillars

**1. The Orchestrator’s Journey (Progression)**
The game is built around the satisfying fantasy of scaling. Moving from a solo developer dragging tickets across a Kanban board to managing a massive, multi-class Enterprise team must feel like a monumental, earned power trip. Every new hire, class unlock, and office upgrade should meaningfully change how the game plays.

**2. Systemic Consequence (Fairness & Simulation)**
Failure and friction must never be arbitrary. If a Sprint fails or a developer burns out, it is the direct result of the player’s prior choices (e.g., accepting a bad contract, ignoring Tech Debt, or failing to cross-train staff). The simulation must feel deep, reactive, and fair. Crucially, unlocking "Agile" methodologies is not a magic fix—it merely *exposes* problems (like physical Tech Debt sludge) that the player must actively manage.

**3. Tactile Abstraction (The "Juice")**
Dry software development concepts must be translated into tactile, physical mechanics to avoid the "Spreadsheet Trap." A bottleneck isn't just a slowing progress bar; it's a physically vibrating, bright-red UI element on the Sprint Board that demands immediate interaction.

**Pillar Priority:** 
When pillars conflict, prioritize **Systemic Consequence** over **Tactile Abstraction**. If we must choose between a fun, bouncy mini-game and an accurate simulation of burnout/tech debt, the integrity of the simulation wins.

### Primary Mechanics

- **Sprint Planning (Drag & Drop):** Selecting contracts and moving User Stories/Epics from the Backlog to the active Sprint Board, balancing the point load against the team's Velocity.
- **Intervention (Tap & Spend):** Spending Leadership Points (LP) to manually smash Blockers, steamroll perfectionist devs, or trigger class-specific Limit Breaks during a live Sprint.
- **Resource Balancing (Manage):** Weighing the short-term gains of Crunch and Tech Debt against the long-term penalties of Burnout and Bug Avalanches.
- **Pressure Release Valves (Recover):** Utilizing emergency tools like the "Refactor Sprint" or sending devs to the Break Room to halt feature progression but rapidly clear Tech Debt and restore Morale, preventing a systemic death spiral.
- **Team Cultivation (Upgrade):** Hiring specific employee archetypes, managing their Morale, and grinding Job XP to unlock prestige classes (e.g., The Full Stack Sorcerer).
- **The Culture Pivot (Invest):** Spending Reputation at milestones to permanently alter the office's aesthetic and mechanical base stats (Startup Disruptor vs. Corporate Enterprise).

**Core Loop:** 
Accept Contract -> Plan Sprint -> Manage Live Blockers/Crisis -> Ship Product -> Retro/Review -> Invest Profits (Hiring/Upgrades) -> Repeat.

### Player Experience Goals

**The Tension of the Deadline:**
The thrilling, sweat-inducing panic of watching the final days of a Sprint tick down while a massive "Merge Conflict" blocker appears on the board.

**The Dopamine of the Perfect Burndown:**
The intense satisfaction of watching the team hit a "Flow State," rapidly clearing the board and securing a flawless release and maximum payout.

**The "Aha!" of System Mastery:**
The moment the player realizes that their failure wasn't bad luck, but poor planning, and the subsequent joy of restructuring their team to completely crush the next contract.
